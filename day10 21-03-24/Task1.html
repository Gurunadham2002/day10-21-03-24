                The culture of Hyderabad is a diverse one. Not only does it have an amalgamation of different cultures, Hyderabad boasts of a rich cultural heritage too. 
                Being ruled by the Asaf Jahi dynasty, it came to be known as the “city of Nizams”. As this dynasty crumpled, 
                the Mughals took over and brought about a sea change in the cultural outlook of the people. Today Hyderabad flourishes in its rich cultural history.
                You will find a very surprising element in these people. 
                They wear the latest branded stuff, flaunt attitude and drink gallons of beer in the most happening bar. 
                But when it comes to culture, no one can beat them nor question their traditional beliefs.
                You will find the most pretty women wearing shorts and tank-tops one day and at a temple in a nice traditional saree the other day! 
                So be prepared to contact the blend of tradition and modernity in the unique city of Hyderabad.
                Hyderabad emerged as the foremost centre of culture in India with the decline of the Mughal Empire.
                After the fall of Delhi in 1857, the migration of performing artists to the city particularly from the north and west of the Indian subcontinent,
                under the patronage of the Nizam, enriched the cultural milieu.
                This migration resulted in a mingling of North and South Indian languages,
                cultures and religions, which has since led to a co-existence of Hindu and Muslim traditions, for which the city has become noted.
                A further consequence of this north-south mix is that both Telugu and Urdu are official languages of Telangana.
                The mixing of religions has also resulted in many festivals being celebrated in Hyderabad such as Ganesh Chaturthi ( Khairtabad Ganesh is one of the tallest Lord Ganesh Idol installed at Khairtabad, Hyderabad, India ), 
                Diwali and Bonalu of Hindu tradition and Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha by Muslims. Traditional Hyderabadi garb also reveals a mix of Muslim and South Asian influences with men wearing sherwani and kurta– paijama and women wearing khara dupatta and salwar kameez. 
                Muslim women also commonly wear burqas and hijabs in public.
                 In addition to the traditional Indian and Muslim garments, increasing exposure to western cultures has led to a rise in the wearing of western style clothing among youths.
                 Hyderabad has continued with these traditions in its annual Hyderabad Literary Festival, held since 2010, showcasing the city’s literary and cultural creativity. 
                 Organisations engaged in the advancement of literature include the Sahitya Akademi, the Urdu Academy, 
                 the Telugu Academy, the National Council for Promotion of Urdu Language, the Comparative Literature Association of India, and the Andhra Saraswata Parishad. 
                 Literary development is further aided by state institutions such as the State Central Library, 
                 the largest public library in the state which was established in 1891, 
                 and other major libraries including the Sri Krishna Devaraya Andhra Bhasha Nilayam, 
                 the British Library and the Sundarayya Vignana Kendram. South Indian music and dances such as the Kuchipudi and Kathakali styles are popular in the Deccan region. 
                 As a result of their culture policies, North Indian music and dance gained popularity during the rule of the Mughals and Nizams, 
                 and it was also during their reign that it became a tradition among the nobility to associate themselves with Tawaif (courtesans). 
                 These courtesans were revered as the epitome of etiquette and culture and were appointed to teach singing, poetry and classical dance to many children of the aristocracy. 
                 This gave rise to certain styles of court music, dance and poetry. 
                 Besides western and Indian popular music genres such as film music, the residents of Hyderabad play city-based Marfa music, 
                 dholak ke geet (household songs based on local Folklore), and qawwali, especially at weddings, festivals and other celebratory events. 
                 The state government organises the Golconda Music and Dance Festival, the Taramati Music Festival and the Premavathi Dance Festival to further encourage the development of music.
                 Films in the local Hyderabadi dialect are also produced and have been gaining popularity since 2005.
                 The city has also hosted international film festivals such as the International Children’s Film Festival and the Hyderabad International Film Festival In 2005, G
                 uinness World Records declared Ramoji Film City to be the world’s largest film studio
                 The region is well known for its Golconda and Hyderabad painting styles which are branches of Deccani painting. 
                 Developed during the 16th century, the Golconda style is a native style blending foreign techniques and bears some similarity to the Vijayanagara paintings of neighbouring Mysore. 
                 Significant use of luminous gold and white colours is generally found in the Golconda style. 
                 The Hyderabad style originated in the 17th century under the Nizams. 
                 Highly influenced by Mughal painting, this style makes use of bright colours and mostly depicts regional landscape, 
                 culture, costumes and jewellery.Hyderabad BiryaniCuisine Hyderabadi cuisine comprises a broad repertoire of rice, wheat and meat dishes and theskilled use of various spices.
                  Hyderabadi biryani and Hyderabadi haleem, with their blend of Mughlai and Arab cuisines,have become iconic dishes of India. 
                  Hyderabadi cuisine is highly influenced by Mughlai and to some extent by French, Arabic, Turkish, Iranian and native Telugu and Marathwada cuisines. 
                  Other popular native dishes include nihari, chakna, baghara baingan and the desserts qubani ka meetha, double ka meetha and kaddu ki kheer (a sweet porridge made with sweet gourd).

                The origin of the Ayodhya Ram Mandir can be traced back to the ancient Hindu epic, Ramayana.
                According to the epic, Ayodhya is the birthplace of Lord Rama.
                Later, the Mughals constructed Babri Masjid mosque on the same site,
                which is believed to be the site of the Ram Janmabhoomi, the birthplace of Rama.
                The 2.7-acre main Ayodhya Ram temple complex will be home to the holy idol of Lord Rama.
                On a raised platform Ayodhya Ram Mandir construction is being done and spans three levels.
                The Ayodhya Ram Mandir is being built on the principles of Vastu Shastra and Shilpa Shastras,
                an ancient Indian architectural science. The temple’s dimensions are impressive,
                measuring 235 feet wide by 360 feet long by 161 feet high.
                Ayodhya Ram Mandir will be the largest temple in India, as per its design structure.

                The land of Varanasi (Kashi) has been the ultimate pilgrimage spot for Hindus for ages.
                Hindus believe that one who is graced to die on the land of Varanasi would attain salvation and freedom from the cycle of birth and re-birth.
                Abode of Lord Shiva and Parvati, the origins of Varanasi are yet unknown.
                Ganges in Varanasi is believed to have the power to wash away the sins of mortals.
                Hindus believe that one who is graced to die on the land of Varanasi would attain salvation and freedom from the cycle of birth and re-birth.
                The city is a center of learning and civilization for over 3000 years.
                Ganges is said to have its origins in the tresses of Lord Shiva and in Varanasi,
                it expands to the mighty river that we know of.
                With Sarnath, the place where Buddha preached his first sermon after enlightenment,
                just 10 km away, Varanasi has been a symbol of Hindu renaissance. Knowledge,
                philosophy, culture, devotion to Gods, Indian arts and crafts have all flourished here for centuries.
                Also a pilgrimage place for Jains, Varanasi is believed to be the birthplace of Parsvanath, 
                the twenty-third Tirthankar. Vaishnavism and Shaivism have co-existed in Varanasi harmoniously.
